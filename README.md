Internship Tasks Submission Repository üìÅ

## Introduction

Welcome to my repository! 
Here, you'll find the collection of the tasks that I've completed as part of my internship experience with CodSoft.
In this repository, you will find organized files for each task along with the documents and codes.

### Description
Description of the Projects:

     TASK 1: MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION- To Create a machine-learning model that can predict the genre of a
                                         movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You
                                         can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers
                                         such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.
     
     TASK 2: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION- To detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset 
                                          containing information about credit card transactions, and 
                                          experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision 
                                          Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or 
                                          legitimate.

     TASK 3: CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION- Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based 
                                        service or business. Use historical customer data, including features like 
                                        usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like Logistic 
                                        Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.
