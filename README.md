## Introduction

Welcome to my repository! 
Here, you'll find the collection of the tasks that I've completed as part of my internship experience with CodSoft.
In this repository, you will find organized files for each task along with the documents and codes.

### Description
Description of the Projects:
     
     TASK 1: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION- To detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a dataset 
                                          containing information about credit card transactions, and 
                                          experimenting with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision 
                                          Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or 
                                          legitimate.

     TASK 2: CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION- Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based 
                                        service or business. Using historical customer data, including features like 
                                        usage behavior and customer demographics, and trying algorithms like Logistic 
                                        Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.

     TASK 3: SPAM SMS DETECTION- To build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or
                                 legitimate. Using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with
                                 classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
                                 Machines to identify spam messages.
